        <h1>Bio</h1>

        <p>Hi, there. I'm Miles, a web developer from Sioux Falls, South Dakota.</p>

        <p>I'm <a href="http://miles.ink" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Miles.ink, my writing website.">a writer for people</a> and <a href="https://github.com/awayken" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="My GitHub account.">a writer for computers</a>. I seemed destined to spend my time at a keyboard.</p>

        <p>In my work time, I lead a team of frontend developers where we're building user interfaces using <a href="https://angular.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Angular</a>.</p>

        <p>In my personal time, <a href="http://miles.ink/read/" rel="noopener noreferrer">I write poetry, short stories and novels</a>. I'm like a really legit writer who can write good and stuff.</p>

        <p>I'm self-motivated and self-disciplined. My goal with every project is producing the best product for the end user. I try to achieve this by writing my own code, adhering to HTML standards and best practices, and constantly and tirelessly learning and growing my craft.</p>
