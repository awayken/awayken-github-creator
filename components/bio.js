        <h1>Bio</h1>

        <p>Hi, there. I'm Miles, a web developer from Sioux Falls, South Dakota.</p>

        <p>I'm <a href="http://miles.ink" rel="noopener" title="Miles.ink, my writing website.">a writer for people</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/awayken" rel="noopener" title="My GitHub account.">a writer for computers</a>. I seemed destined to spend my time at a keyboard.</p>

        <p>In my work time, I develop for both server (in CFML using <a href="http://lucee.org" rel="noopener">the Lucee engine</a>) and client (where I try to be <a href="https://www.w3.org/wiki/The_principles_of_unobtrusive_JavaScript" rel="noopener">unobtrusive</a>, <a href="https://alistapart.com/article/semanticsinhtml5" rel="noopener">semantic</a> and <a href="http://cssnext.io" rel="noopener">responsibly future-facing</a>).
        At the same time, I've been having a flirty affair with <a href="https://nodejs.org" rel="noopener">Node.js</a> and <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/" rel="noopener">React</a>. We're very much in love, although I'm not quite ready to commit.</p>

        <p>In my personal time, <a href="http://miles.ink/read/" rel="noopener">I write short stories and novels</a>. Fiction is as strong a passion for me as programming, and I have published in some online publications and some print magazines. So, I'm like a really legit writer who can write good and stuff.</p>

        <p>I'm self-motivated and self-disciplined. My goal with every project is producing the best product for the end user. I try to achieve this by writing my own code, adhering to HTML standards and best practices, and constantly and tirelessly learning and growing my craft.</p>

        <p>Also, I'm funny. (I mean, not so much right now, but usually.)</p>
